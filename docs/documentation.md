### Publish / Subscribe

Hub.js is an implementation of the [publish-subscribe
pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern).

A subscription is made like this:

```js
hub.on('event', function () {
  console.log('oh, hi!');
});
```

All listeners registered for `'event'` can be invoked using `emit`:

```js
hub.emit('event');
```

Anything following the event name is used as a arguments:

```js
hub.on('log', function (message) {
  console.log(message);
});
hub.emit('log', 'oh, hi!'); 
```

The `on` function allows to register multiple listeners:

```js
hub.on({
  'log': function (message) {
    console.log(message);
  },
  'warn': function (message) {
    console.warn(message);
  }
});
```


#### Call order

One of the design goals of hub.js is to guarantee a predictable call order of
listeners.

- Listeners are always called in registration order.
- The call order of "wildcard subscriptions" depends on where the wildcards are
  used: More generic listeners are called before more specific ones.

Wildcard subscriptions are explained further down on this page.


### Return values

Listeners may return a value to the publisher either by using the `return`
keyword, or by using a callback.

```js
hub.on('answer', function () {
  return 42;
});
```

To use a callback, simply declare one:

```js
hub.on('answer', function (callback) {
  callback(null, 42); // Node style callbacks (err, value)
});
```

Both of the above examples will work with this publisher:

```js
hub.emit('answer', function (err, value) {
  assert.equal(value, 42);
});
```

This makes it possible to change listener implementations from synchronous to
asynchronous without changing the publishers.


### Error handling

There are two ways to indicate an error condition:

1. An exception is thrown in a listener
2. A callback is invoked with a value as the first argument

Both cases are handled in the same way and in this order:

- If the publisher passed a callback to `emit`, the callback is invoked with
  the error as the first argument
- If an error handler is registered, the error is passed to the handler
- The error is thrown

All examples below assume that we have this listener implementation:

```js
hub.on('something.throws', function () {
  throw new Error('whoups');
});
```

#### Error handling with callbacks

```js
hub.emit('something.throws', function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err);
  }
  // ...
});
```

#### Error handler

This is a "catch all" handler that will cause the hub instance to never throw.

```js
hub.on('error', function (err) {
  console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err);
});
```

#### Exception handling

In case we do not pass a callback to `emit` and we don't have any of the above
error handlers installed, the error will be thrown by emit:

```js
try {
  hub.emit('something.throws');
} catch (err) {
  console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err);
}
```


### Wildcard subscriptions

When subscribing to an event, the event name may contain wildcards.

The following example would match the events `ajax.get` and `ajax.post`:

```js
hub.on('ajax.*', function () { /* ... */ });
```

However, `ajax.\*` does not match `ajax.get.extended`. The dot acts as a
separator between event name parts. To match multiple event name parts, use a
double wildcard, e.g. `ajax.\*\*`.

If a subscriber is registered with an event that contains wildcards, it is
called a "matcher". Matchers are invoked before listeners.

Unless listeners, matchers do not get invoked in registration order. The more
generic matchers are invoked before the more specific ones, e.g. if `a.b.c` is
emitted, a listener on `a.\*\*` is invoked before a listener on `a.b.\*`.


### Broadcasting

Emitting an event with wildcards (\* or \*\*) is called "broadcasting". Any
listeners matching the given event will be invoked. This also applies for
"matchers" (see Wildcard subscriptions).

```js
hub.emit('**.destroy');
```


### Events emitted by hub.js

These events are emitted by each hub instance itself:

#### newListener

Calling `on` or `once` triggers a `newListener` event passing the event name
and the listener function as arguments. If a filter on this event does not
invoke `next`, the listener will not be registered.

#### removeListener

Calling `un` triggers a `removeListener` event passing the event name and the
listener function as arguments. If a filter on this event does not invoke
`next`, the listener will not be removed.


### Views

A view is created with `hub.view('some.namespace')`. The returned object has
exactly the same API as the hub instance, but all operations are relative to
the specified namespace.

```js
var view = hub.view('some.namespace');

// Register a listener on 'some.namespace.event':
view.on('event', function () { /* ... */ });

// Emit an event on 'some.namespace.event':
view.emit('event');
```

### API reference

All listeners and callbacks are invoked with a special `this` object which is
described in the next section.

#### hubjs(\[listeners\])

The hub module exports a factory function which takes optional listeners and
returns a hub instance. All functions in the given listeners object will be
installed on the hub instance using on.

#### hub.on(event, function)

Registers a listener for an event (see "Publish / Subscribe"). The event may
contain \* or \*\* to register a "matcher". If the listener function expects
more arguments than are passed to `emit`, the last argument will be a callback
function. The listener is expected to invoke the callback once completed with
an error object or `null` and an optional return value.

#### hub.on(object)

Calls `hub.on` for each event / function pair in object. Functions on the
prototype of the object will be registered as well.

#### hub.on(prefix, object)

Calls `hub.on(event, function)` for each event / function pair in `object` with
the given prefix. The prefix and the object properties are joined with a dot.
Functions on the prototype of the object will be registered as well.

#### hub.addListener(...)

Is an alias for `hub.on`.

#### hub.un(event, function)

Unregisters a single listener for an event.

#### hub.un(object)

Calls `hub.un(event, function)` for each event / function pair in `object` with
the given prefix. The prefix and the object properties are joined with a dot.
Functions on the prototype of the object will be registered as well.

#### hub.removeListener(...)

Is an alias for `hub.un`.

#### hub.removeAllListeners()

Unregisters all listeners.

#### hub.removeAllListeners(event)

Unregisters all listeners for the given event.

#### hub.removeAllMatching(event)

Unregisters all listeners that match the given event name. This removes all
listeners that would be invoked if the given event would be emitted.

#### hub.once(event, function)

Registers a listerner for an event that will be automatically unregistered on
the first invocation.

#### hub.emit(event\[, arg1, arg2, ...\]\[, callback\])

Invokes all listeners for an event. The optional arguments are passed to each
listener. The event may contain `\*` or `\*\*` to invoke all listeners
registered for matching events (see "Broadcasting"). The optional callback will
be invoked once all listeners returned. The first argument is an error if at
least one of the listeners threw, the second argument is the return value.

The given event can alternatively be an object containing at least an event
property. Optional properties can be:

- `allResults` _[Boolean]_: set to `true` to collect all listener return
  values and pass them to the given callback as an array. Default is `false`
  in which case only the last return value is passed.

Example:

```js
hub.emit({ event : 'some.event', allResults : true }, function (err, values) {
  // ...
});
```

#### hub.listeners(event)

Returns an array of all listeners for the given event. This does not include
matchers (see `hub.listenersMatching(event)`).

#### hub.listenersMatching(event)

Returns an array of all listeners that match the given event. This returns all
listeners that would be invoked if the given event would be emitted.

#### hub.view(namespace)

Creates a view object (instanceof `hub.View`) that implements the full hub API,
but maps all events relatively to the specified namespace (see "Views").


### API of 'this' in listeners

Listeners and callbacks are always called with a special scope object (`this`).
The exposed properties are not supposed to be modified.

#### hub

The hub instance.

#### event

The current event.

#### args

The arguments passed to emit without the event.

#### allResults

true if `emit` was call with `allResults` set to true, otherwise false.

#### callback([timeout])

Returns a callback that has to be invoked for the operation to complete.
Listeners may obtain mutliple callbacks. The next even phase will be entered
once all callbacks where invoked.

The optional timeout specifies the time in milliseconds after which the
callback will time out, resulting in a `TimeoutError`.
